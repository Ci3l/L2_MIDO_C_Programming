# Programmation C - L2 MIDO

## Course Overview
This repository contains the tutorials from my *Programmation C* course at Paris-Dauphine University, where I am enrolled in the second year of the *Mathematics and Applied Computer Science for Decision-Making* (MIDO) program.

### Instructor
**Emmanuel Lazard**

### Course Hours
49.5 hours

### Topics Covered
- **Types and Expressions**: Learning fundamental C data types and operators.
- **Control Structures**: Implementing conditionals and loops for program flow.
- **Functions**: Writing and calling functions in C.
- **Arrays and Pointers**: Exploring array manipulation and pointer usage.
- **Structures**: Organizing data with `struct`.
- **Preprocessor**: Utilizing preprocessor directives in C code.
- **Input/Output**: Managing user input and output.

## Repository Structure
The tutorials are split into two main categories:
- **`theoretical_tutorials`**: Contains theoretical exercises (travaux dirigés) focusing on the underlying concepts and theory of C programming.
- **`practical_tutorials`**: Includes practical exercises (travaux pratiques) for hands-on coding practice and application.

Each folder is organized by tutorial sessions, labeled sequentially (e.g., `tuto_1`, `tuto_2`).

## How to Use This Repository
Explore the **theoretical_tutorials** for in-depth understanding of C programming concepts, and check out the **practical_tutorials** for applied coding exercises. You are welcome to suggest improvements, report issues, or ask questions by opening an issue or pull request. I hope this repository serves as a helpful learning resource for others in C programming.
